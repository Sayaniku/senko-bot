# Senko bot source code
This is the source code of senko, one of my private bot maked for my french server "L'antre des renards et kitsune", I decided to make the source code free for everyone based on any fork at this time, they will be 100% free and everything is developped by me 

If you want to init the project on your pc, you need to make ``npm i`` and after you can run the index.js with node

Nodejs 20.17 LTS is needed

If you want edit the source code, please use nodemon (npm i -g nodemon), he's needed to be installed globally (for mac you can check because a little bit special)
